# Tutorial: How to clear your cache and cookies on Google Chrome

## Step 1: Open the web browser Google Chrome
Hopefully this is a given to everyone, but you do need an open window for this process.

## Step 2: Click the 3 vertical dots
Navigate to the 3 vertical dots in the top right hand corner of your window and click on them.

## Step 3: Hover your mouse over "More Tools" and then click "Clear Browsing Data..."
You will find "More Tools" about 2/3 of the way down the drop down menu and "Clear Browsing Data" midway through the slide out menu. I have circled them in red below:

## Step 4: Click "Clear Data"
You can change the time range at the top for the desired amount of data you wish to clear. You can also uncheck any boxes you wish to not clear such as browsing history. Example below:

I hope this solves any problems you are having with cookies or your cache on Chrome
